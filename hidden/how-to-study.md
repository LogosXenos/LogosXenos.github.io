# Full notes

## Ch 1 The Proper Mental Attitude
- The student must distinguish clearly between reading and understanding.
- The student must clearly distinguish mere facts from conclusions or opinions.
- The student's mind should be a continual interrogation point.
- Regarding facts which he does not then investigate the reason for, he should ask how they are ascertained.
- The student must train himself to be constantly on the watch for evidence of reliability in the writer he is studying, in order that he may get a correct impression as to whether his statements of fact may be accepted, as well as his conclusions and opinions.
- Another essential element of a proper attitude of mind is caution. 
- Study with an open mind, and with no preconceived ideas.
- Be modest intellectually, yet self-reliant. Train yourself to love correction.
- Remember that the object of study should be to gain wisdom, rather than knowledge. 

## Ch 2 Studying Understandingly
- The student should acquire and insist upon exercising the habit of forming definite ideas.
	- Study the dictionary
	- Define some common words each day and compare with dictionary
	- Study logic
- Learn to state a thing in different ways or from different points of view
- State a thing not only positively but negatively
- In studying a statement, observe which are the necessary words and whether there are any unnecessary ones which might be omitted
- Reflect upon what is read: Illustrate and apply a result after reaching it, before passing on to something else
- Keep the mind active and alert
- When you meet with differences of opinion upon a subject, reflect upon the reasons which may cause intelligent men to arrive at different conclusions
	- Caused by mistakes in facts or principles
	- Caused by incorrect reasoning
	- Caused by facts interpreted disproportionately
	- Caused by stubbornness of the human mind
- Statement is not a proof. You do not understand a conclusion unless you can see the steps in its logical demonstration
- Recommended books:
	- *Talks to Teachers* by Professor James
	- *The Study of Words* by Archbishop Trench
	- *Elementary Lessons in Logic* by Jevon
	- *Logic* by John Stuart Mill
	- *The Principles of Argumentation* by Baker and Huntington

## Ch3 System
- Discover the fundamental idea of the subject
- Before you begin to study a subject, think it over carefully and find out what you already know of it or what you can arrive at by your unaided efforts
- Classify and arrange what you have learned 

## Ch4 Mental Initiative
- Cultivate an interest in what you are studying, and some idea of what it leads to 
- Insist upon first clearly formulating the problem, if one is before you
- Work independently of others
- Draw your own conclusions, whenever possible, before you know those of the writer you are studying
- If you cannot see how the author reaches a stated conclusion, because he does not indicate the process which he follows, do not spend too much time trying to find out how he did it, but rather see if you can come to a conclusion in your own way, thus cultivating your own power and initiative rather than following the author
- Learn to generalise
- Go beyond the book
- Visualise your results so far as possible

## Ch5 Proper Habits and Methods of Work
- Select the best book for your purposes and study it thoroughly
- Do not study too many subjects at once
	- 3 to 5 studies are as many as the student can profitably pursue at once
- Do not be in a hurry
- Do not take up a study lightly, but when taken up do not abandon it without good cause
- Cultivate the power of judicious skipping
	- Skip parts based on why you want to study it
- Be systematic
	- Make studying a habit by setting times for your study
- Cultivate the power, by habitual practice, of fixing your mind intensely upon one thing for a considerable time
- Remember to apply what you are studying
- Be interested thoroughly in what you are doing
- Read the important things again and again until you know your book thoroughly
- Make a list of references as you proceed
	- Learn where to find what you do not know
- Review your work frequently
- Set special times for your recreational study
	- Do not develop in a one-sided manner, have interests outside your main study
- In connection with your studies do not neglect proper physical exercise
- Recommended books:
	- *The Principles and Practice of Teaching and Class Management* by Joseph Landon
	- *How to Study and Teaching How to Study* by Frank M. McMurry
	- *Teaching Children to Study* by Lida B. Earhart
