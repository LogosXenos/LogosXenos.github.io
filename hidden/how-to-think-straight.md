## Ch 1 The Basic Equipment
- Arguments are either valid or invalid, while proposition are either true or false.
- **Proposition**: Whatever may be asserted or denied
	- Characteristic is truth and falsity
	- **Refute**: Show that a proposition is true, and not just saying
- Arguments concern about relations between propositions
- A valid argument does not imply that its constituent propositions are true
	- A valid deduction means that denying its conclusion will lead to contradictions with its premise
- Reason someone will insist on a contradictory statement:
	- Disingenuous
	- Does not fully understand the meaning of the words used
		- **Universal proposition fallacy**: Over-generalisation of a few instances
		- **Equivocation**: Using the same word for 2 or more different meanings without differentiating it in the same context

	> **Socrates**  
	> We must follow the argument wherever it leads.
- From any pair of contradictory propositions affirmed, any propositions (including their negations) can be proven to be true
	- Suppose the contradiction is x and ~x <br>
	Consider an arbitrary statement y <br>
	Then x or y must be true <br>
	And if we also assert ~x to be true, then necessarily y must be true, regardless of what y is.

	> **Bertrand Russell**  
	> A pedant is a person who prefers his statements to be true
- **Logically impossible**: Something that leads to self-contradiction
- **Factually impossible**: Something that is prohibited by the laws of nature
- **The Problem of Evil**: There is evil in a Universe with an all-powerful all-good God
	- Resolution: There is no good without the actual evils
- Confusion with "contradiction"
	- **Usage 1**: Logical inconsistencies (appearing in discourse)
	- **Usage 2**: Conflict or tension between things
	- "Fruitful or non-antagonistic contradiction" can only be of Usage 2
- Confusion with Logic:
	- **logic**: The usual meaning
	- **Logic**: An academic discipline studying logic
	- Logic is not needed to improve logic. Improving logic needs only to determine if an argument is valid
- Confusion with racism:
	- **Meaning 1**: Judging an individual based on its race
	- **Meaning 2**: There is a difference *on average* between different races
	- Meaning 1 is bad, but meaning 2 is okay. To enforce a racial ratio in society is racist (meaning 1).
- **Fallacy**: Mistaking an invalid argument for a valid one
- **The Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle**
	- Aka **The Un-American Fallacy**
	- If all A is a, <br>
	  and if B is a, <br>
	  Then B is A.
- **The Pathetic Fallacy**:
	- Perhaps the simplest and most psychologically satisfying explanation of any observed phenomenon is that it happened that way because someone wanted it to happen that way.
	- This is not a fallacy, but a misconception.
- **Post hoc ergo propter hoc**:
	- Whatever follows must be the consequence 
- Be exact with word usage. Do not abuse word meaning.
	- He knows &ne; He claims to know
	- We should not use the word *prejudice* only because it is other people's opinions.
		- **prejudice**: A preconceived judgement or opinion formed without just grounds or before sufficient knowledge
	- **The sense of a word**: The meaning <br>
	  **The reference of a word**: The object 
		- Eg: The morning star and the evening star have different senses but the same referent. 
- **The Masked Man Fallacy**:
	- If someone knows something under one description, then they must know it as the same thing under another description.
	- The fallacy occurs because we confuse the subject's knowledge of an object with the object itself.
	- Eg: If someone is well acquainted with a masked man, the they must know the identity of the masked man
