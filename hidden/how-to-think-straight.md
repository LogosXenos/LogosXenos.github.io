# Full notes

## Ch 1 The Basic Equipment
- Arguments are either valid or invalid, while proposition are either true or false.
- **Proposition**: Whatever may be asserted or denied
	- Characteristic is truth and falsity
	- **Refute**: Show that a proposition is true, and not just saying
- Arguments concern about relations between propositions
- A valid argument does not imply that its constituent propositions are true
	- A valid deduction means that denying its conclusion will lead to contradictions with its premise
- Reason someone will insist on a contradictory statement:
	- Disingenuous
	- Does not fully understand the meaning of the words used
		- **Universal proposition fallacy**: Over-generalisation of a few instances
		- **Equivocation**: Using the same word for 2 or more different meanings without differentiating it in the same context

	> **Socrates**  
	> We must follow the argument wherever it leads.
- From any pair of contradictory propositions affirmed, any propositions (including their negations) can be proven to be true
	- Suppose the contradiction is x and ~x <br>
	Consider an arbitrary statement y <br>
	Then x or y must be true <br>
	And if we also assert ~x to be true, then necessarily y must be true, regardless of what y is.

	> **Bertrand Russell**  
	> A pedant is a person who prefers his statements to be true
- **Logically impossible**: Something that leads to self-contradiction
- **Factually impossible**: Something that is prohibited by the laws of nature
- **The Problem of Evil**: There is evil in a Universe with an all-powerful all-good God
	- Resolution: There is no good without the actual evils
- Confusion with "contradiction"
	- **Usage 1**: Logical inconsistencies (appearing in discourse)
	- **Usage 2**: Conflict or tension between things
	- "Fruitful or non-antagonistic contradiction" can only be of Usage 2
- Confusion with Logic:
	- **logic**: The usual meaning
	- **Logic**: An academic discipline studying logic
	- Logic is not needed to improve logic. Improving logic needs only to determine if an argument is valid
- Confusion with racism:
	- **Meaning 1**: Judging an individual based on its race
	- **Meaning 2**: There is a difference *on average* between different races
	- Meaning 1 is bad, but meaning 2 is okay. To enforce a racial ratio in society is racist (meaning 1).
- **Fallacy**: Mistaking an invalid argument for a valid one
- **The Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle**
	- Aka **The Un-American Fallacy**
	- If all A is a, <br>
	  and if B is a, <br>
	  Then B is A.
- **The Pathetic Fallacy**:
	- Perhaps the simplest and most psychologically satisfying explanation of any observed phenomenon is that it happened that way because someone wanted it to happen that way.
	- This is not a fallacy, but a misconception.
- **Post hoc ergo propter hoc**:
	- Whatever follows must be the consequence 
- Be exact with word usage. Do not abuse word meaning.
	- He knows &ne; He claims to know
	- We should not use the word *prejudice* only because it is other people's opinions.
		- **prejudice**: A preconceived judgement or opinion formed without just grounds or before sufficient knowledge
	- **The sense of a word**: The meaning <br>
	  **The reference of a word**: The object 
		- Eg: The morning star and the evening star have different senses but the same referent. 
- **The Masked Man Fallacy**:
	- If someone knows something under one description, then they must know it as the same thing under another description.
	- The fallacy occurs because we confuse the subject's knowledge of an object with the object itself.
	- Eg: If someone is well acquainted with a masked man, the they must know the identity of the masked man

## Ch2 If/Then and All/None
- **Denying the Consequent**: If p then q. ~q, so ~p.
	- Valid argument
	- **Resolution 1**: The hypothesis p is false
	- **Resolution 2**: Reinterpret the meaning of the hypothesis p
- **Affirming the Consequent**: If p then q. q, so p.
	- Invalid argument
- **Affirming the Antecedent**: If p then q. p, so q.
	- Valid argument
- **Denying the Antecedent**: If p then q. ~p, so ~q.
	- Invalid argument
- There is an asymmetry in verifying and falsifying hypotheses. It is easy to disprove a hypothesis (denying the consequent), but difficult to ensure the hypothesis is correct.
- **Universal proposition**: Statements involving every member of a set
	- Can be disproved by just one counterexample
	> **Karl Popper** <br>
	> No open universal proposition can be confirmed beyond all conceivable future correction, though some can be decisively disproved. 
	- Scientific theories cannot be confirmed to be logically true, but it can be demonstrated to be practically true
- **Sufficient condition**: If p then q
- **Necessary condtion**: If ~p then ~q
- Sufficient and necessary = If and only if = Iff
- *Causally* necessary and *causally* sufficient conditions are conditions that pertains to the law of nature, as opposed to *logical* conditions that leads to logical contradictions if denied.
- Example: Heredity vs. Surroundings
	- **Correct argument**: Heredity contributes to the ability we have
	- **Fallacy**: Heredity decides everything in life
	- It is tempting to convert opponent's argument to a universal one for ease of attack, but this is a fallacy
	- We should not strive for the middle ground but the truth. If the truth is extreme, then so be it.
	- The negation of a universal statement is its contradictory statement, not the contrary statement
		- Negation of *Every* is *Not all*, not *Nothing*.
## Ch 3 Evasion and Falsification
- **No-true-Scotsman Move**: Using arbitrary redefinition to make the original statement true.
- **Apriori truth**: The truth of the statement does not refer to anything else.
	- **Analytically necessary**: Truth is known purely by understanding the meaning of the words.
	- **Logically necessary**: Denying the statement logically leads to contradiction.
- **Aposteriori truth**: The truth of the statement depends on what can/have happened
	- **Synthetic statement**: Truth cannot be known purely by understanding the meaning of the words
	- **Logically contingent**: The contradiction of the statement is not necessarily true or false
- The No-true-Scotsman Move modifies the definition of words so the statement becomes an apriori truth.
	- A more serious error is to immediately forget about the redefinition in usage afterwards
- **Eg**: Does mental health causes crime, or is crime used to define a mental health condition?
- **Eg**: Selfishness &ne; Self-interest. To pursue self-interest is not necessarily selfish, and it is okay.
- **Eg**: Literature is an integral part of society by definition, but this statement does not necessarily mean that literature reflects the times.
- p = ~ ~ p
	- To assert something is the same as to deny its contradiction
	> **Spanish Proverb**
	> 'Take what you like,' said God, 'take it, and pay for it.'
- *Karl Popper*: Falsifiability is the demarcation between science and non-science
	- If a theory is not falsifiable, it is not a science. 
	- **Eg**: Witchcraft, psychoanalysis
- **It-isn't-true-only-because-of-why-it-is objection**: When the proposition is undeniable, the focus is shifted to the cause of the proposition 
	- Such move is implicitly agreeing to the truth of the proposition, but beliefs through discussing about its cause
	- **Eg**: Racial steoreotypes exists because of its history.
- **Problem of the Seafight**:
	> **Thomas Hobbes** *Of Liberty and Necessity*
	> It is necessary that tomorrow it shall rain or not rain. If it is not necessary that it shall rain, then it shall necessarily not rain.
	
	- The fallacy comes from mistaking the parts of a logical necessary statement as also logically necessary

## Ch4 Motives and Grounds ##

- **But-these-people-will-never-agree diversion**
	- Confusing the truth of a statement with persuading someone about the truth of a statement
	- Only relevant if two parties are working on a compromise, but irrelevant to the truth of a statement
- **Subject/Motive shift**
	- Taking motivation as a proof to the truth of a statement
	- Cause of confusion is because of the 3 meanings of the word "reason"
		- **Meaning 1**: Grounds for believing
		- **Meaning 2**: Motivation for believing
		- **Meaning 3**: Causes of a certain occurence
	- **Eg**: Pascal's wager, W. R. Urban on absurdity of knowledge
		- There is no reason why reason (cause) and reason (ground) should be mutually exclusive
	- Another confusing word: *democracy*
		- **Meaning 1**: Liberal, as in possible to vote leadership out if citizens so wish
		- **Meaning 2**: Paternalist, as in government do what's best for the people
	- If there is a ambiguity in word meaning, either put parenthetical explanations on the ambiguous word, or replace the word with other more distinguishable words
	- **Eg**: The statement must be false if it is made by an interested party
		- Even a truism may be true
- Sometimes agencies need sufficient evils to preserve their existence or employment
	- This is done by redefining the meaning of said evil
	- **Eg**: Equal Employment Opportunities Commision
		- *Indirect discrimination*: Discrimination caused by preferentially hiring a minority subset to satisfy the quota
	- **Eg**: Lester Thurow defines *discrimination* as all differences in economic prospects and economic achievements between different subsets
		- The cause of discrimination is hidden behind the usage of word *discrimination*
		- This confuses equality of opportunity with equality of outcome
- Legitimate arguments not to be confused with Subject/Motive Shift:
	- If nothing else is known, it is better to accept an evidence from a neutral party than from an interested party
	- **On-your-own-principles Maneuver**
		- Pointing out logical consequences of a statement
		- This is done without commiting to the truth of a statement
		- This is not to be confused with *argumentum ad hominem*
	- It is perfectly fine to talk about motives after the truth of a statement has been established as a supplement to the reasoning. Note, motive is a *supplement*, not a substitute for arguments
- **Eg**: All human judgements are nothing but the tools of unconscious
	- This psychoanalysis statement shifts the focus from truth to motive
	- Problem is Subject/Motive shift always applies to others, not ourselves.
	- The point is, whatever insights psychology or social science can give, it should first and foremost be applied to itself.
- **Fallacy of Pseudorefuting Description**:
	- Refuting an argument by introducing names/categories/descriptions
	- **Eg**: Domino effect, Christian, Conservative, conspiracy theory, witch-hunt

## Ch5 Minding Our Language
- Examples of Fallacy of Pseudorefuting Description:
	- "Racist": Racial differences can be the truth without any discriminatory meanings.
	- Newspeak in *1984* by George Orwell
	- Empty phrases, dead metaphors, and euphemistic abstractions: It distracts away and concel (the lack of) truth
- We should use precise words that convey precise meaning
	- A small change in word choice can change the meaning by a lot
	- The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. People use long and technical words to obscure the meaning
	> **Marquis de Vauvenargues** <br>
	> Obscurity is the kingdom of error.
	>
	> For the philosopher clarity is the matter of good faith.
- **Vague**: What is said is indeterminate in some relevant dimensions <br>
  **Ambiguous**: Meaning can be construed in at least 2 different ways.
	- **Eg of ambiguous**: How did you expect them to behave?
		- Expect (descriptive): What I believe they would in fact do
		- Expect (prescriptive): What I believe they should do
		- *Ambiguous sentence*: England expects every man to do his duty.
	- Vagueness is not a defect of language. Language should allow vagueness if something more cannot be said
	- The vagueness of the premise bounds the preciseness of the conclusion
	- To redefine a vague term to be more precise is to introduce another and different meaning to the word
	- **Eg of ambiguous**: Religious knowledge
		- Weak sense: Knowledge about religious beliefs and practices without implication of truth of beliefs
		- Strong sense: Religious beliefs constitutes an item of knowledge and practices are imperative
		- *Error usage*: Justifying education in the weak sense does not automatically justify education in the strong sense
		- *Error usage*: Those who does not believe the truth in the strong sense may immediately assume no need for education in the weak sense
	- **Eg of ambiguous**: Income of nation
		- Meaning 1: Income of all individual citizens and privately owned firms in the nation
		- Meaning 2: Income acquired and collectively owned by the state
- Obviousness depends on the individual as well as the timing
	- This is not to say anything about the truth of the matter
- We should only think about definitions when there is a possibility of misunderstanding
	- Pedantic requirement to define all terms may be obstructive
	- People can understand the meaning of the word without being able to define them
	- Sometimes a formal definition may not be the best choice. Try defining the terms in context, in how the word should be used and applied
- There are 2 types of definitions:
	- Descriptive: Definiendum equivalent to definiens
		- **Definiendum**: The word to be defined
		- **Definiens**: The proposed equivalent word/phrase
	- Prescriptive/stipulative: Some innovation involved in defining the word
		- This does not allow you to define a word however you like without previously declaring the new meaning
- We should never redefine words with meaning that is in contradiction with its old meaning
	- An established meaning/association of a word is highly difficult to unlearn
- Words have 2 kinds of meaning: *neutral/descriptive* type, and *expressive/emotive* type
	- There is nothing wrong with emotive associations, but do not pretend to redefine the terms to neutral
	- Using emotive words excessively will discrupt rational discourse
	- There is a temptation to use negative emotive words on others but positive emotive words on self (**Eg**: firm, obstinate, pig-headed). This is just being arbitrary
		- Arbitrary discriminations should be removed. Opinions/judgements has to be based on principles that are impaartial and pertaining to truth
- **Persuasive Definition**
	- Redefining words with (un)favourable emotive words with a different descriptive meaning
	- **Eg**: Imprisonment is the true freedom

## Ch6 Figuring
- **Eg**: 70% of people serving in Ruritania prison have served one or more prison terms
	- The mistake is to confuse prison population as a representative of the adult population
	- The statistics does not show those who did not commit crime because of the prison term
	- The statistics cannot show the percentage of first-term servers returning for a second term. This relies data from past or future records, not just the present statistics
- It is easy to misinterpret figures with perfectly correct statistics and no dishonesty from any party
	- We need a basis to benchmark the statistics
	- What is needed to understand statistics is usually not technical, but rather critical alertness
- **Eg**: Discrepancy of pay between men and women
	- Discrepancy did not take into account of types of jobs and hours spent on jobs 
	- The real discrepancy is between married women and everyone else
- Examples of statistic malpractices
	- Compare one's monthly income with another's annual income
	- Compare one's net income (after taxation) with another's gross income (before tax)
- **But-you-can-understand-why Evasion**: Avoiding arguments by appealing to the motivation for mistakes
	- Under **Subject/Motive shift**
- Such misrepresentation of statistics reduces one's ground of argument
- **Eg**: The definition of poverty
	- The class of poor is meaningful if the members of the poor of one year remains the same consistently
	- The definition of poverty should consider aids obtained to talk about disparities of income
- **Eg**: Unequal distribution of wealth in a country
	- If it is shown a company earns a lot of money, what sum of that money can actually be spent? How does it look like when benchmark with bills and wages?
	- What is the meaning of the statistics shown exactly?
	- How are the numbers or data obtained?
	- The *Egalataria* example shows that if everyone has equal pay, 74% of wealth will still be concentrated on the 10% of the richest people
		- The distribution of wealth is different for different age groups
- Baselines are important when considering statistics
- Historical trend analysis can be misleading
	- **Whatever-follows-must-be-the-consequence Fallacy**
- What we need to understand statistics is not technical know-hoow but critical alertness
	- **Eg**: Crimes are created by the Parliament
		- The parliament proscribes what is considered criminal, but do not actually induce people to perform crime
	- **Eg**: The rich made the poor
		- This is true in the relative sense, but not that the rich exploits the poor
	- We have to be alert about what the words actually mean, where the figures come from, and how the statistics is compiled
		- There may be multiple reasons why the figures arise
		- Some results may be obtained by the definition of the statistics and not something remarkable (**Eg**: IQ average of different sets of people)
		- Just because variation in one extreme does not affect the result much, does not mean that the characteristic is altogether unimportant
			- **Eg**: Height variation between basketball players may be irrelevant for their achievements, but the average height of all basketball players are still way taller than the most of us
- Money is systematically ambiguous in time because of inflation

** Ch 7 A Chapter of Errors
- **Fallacy of Many Questions**: When an unwarranted assumption was built into the question
	- **Eg**: When did you stop beating your wife?
	- This is not always a fallacy, but we must always be mindful of presumptions that is in a statement or question
- **Eg**: There are 2 meaning of the word *experience*
	- Objective: The experience is caused by an agent that exist independent of the subject
	- Subjective: What the subject feels or perceives regardless of the existence of an independent agent
	- Just because someone has an experience (subjective) with God, does not mean that the existence of God is objective
- **The Genetic Fallacy**
	- The antecedent of something must be equivalent to their fulfillment or vice versa
	- **Eg**: A fetus is a person because it is going to become one
	- **Eg**: Human is no different from apes or animals
		- While we may retain some primitive psychology or behaviour, to equate human as an ape is a fallacy
		- This has purposefully diminished the effects of environment or learned behaviours as opposed to genetics
	- **Eg**: The selfish gene
		- The fallacy comes from the understanding that gene leads to human traits, and human can be selfish or not, then necessarily we can describe gene as being selfish or not.
		- Being selfish or not only applies to subjects that can make choices
- **Logically-black-is-white Slide**:
	- The difference between two extremes is measured by difference of degree (continuous). Since no sharp transition border can be drawn, then the 2 extremes must essentially the same, or at most the difference is unimportant
	- The temptation is shifting from "This is a difference of degree" to "This is a *mere* difference of degree."
	- **The Sorites/Heaper**: Since a single grain of sand does not make a heap, and since adding one more is at no stage enough to convert what we have into a heap, there cannot really be heaps.
	> **Edmund Burke**<br>
	> Though no man can draw a stroke between the confines of night and day, still night and darkness are on the whole tolerably distinguishable
	- **Misconception**: Since there is no natural breakpoint, and any such border must be arbitrary, then to distinguish between different phases or the line drawn must be totally illogical
- **Is-there-a-third-way Questions**
	- Make sure the extremes proposed are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, at the same a relevant contrast of each other
	- **Eg**: Not everything can be categorised as selfish or unselfish. They can be neither.
	- The possibility of striving to reach the ideal necessarily presupposes and is presupposed by the possibility of defection from it
- For practical reasons, sharp transition boundaries are needed to distinguish two extremes
	- **Eg**: Age between a kid and an adult
	- While the boundary line may be artificial, it is a fallacy to imply that it is arbitrary
	- There is a paradox of little less or little more to these lines. However, these line should be adhered in principle.
		- The little more or little less is not always the case at jeopary most of the time
- While advertisements normally do not blatantly lie, they usually overaccentuate the positive
	- Be mindful of percentages:
		- What are they a percentage of?
		- Is the percentage just a normal mathematical fact made to look nice?
			- **Eg**: A 50% reduction will need a 100% increase to return to its original value
	- Be mindful of graphs:
		- The graphs shown in advertisement may be overexaggerated
			- If sales is correlated to the height, then the graph will be overexaggerated since the area increase much faster than the linear scales
	- **The Naturalistic Fallacy**: He who drives fat oxenmust himself be fat
		- Problem: It goes from what should be to believing it is without more arguments
		- **Eg**: Anything natural should be good because it is what it is ought to be
		- Reason: A personification of nature as a benevolent deity
- The 2 meaning of "cause"
	- **Moral**: A motive for an action that do not always necessarily follow
	- **Physical**: Something that necessarily follows 
	- The causes of crime are of the moral kind, not the physical kind, despite claims of politicians
- The abuse of the word "society"
	- When people say *society* has caused some crime or other, it says nothing, because the word society is undefined

## The Final Foreword
- **Fallacy**: If I cannot do everything right, then I am not obliged or should not do anything at all
- Rationality and personal integrity go hand-in-hand
- It is important to consider if someone is in the position to know (regarding a specific statement)
	- It is not necessary to endless question the arguments of a certain knowledge. Such questioning is needed only as much as there is a chance of doubt
- If we support a program or policy based on some objectives, we should be ready to follow its program to its fruition, and when it turns out that the objective is not achieved, be ready to change our stance
	- We should always update and monitor our progress with respect to our objectives
- Rationality does not guarantee true or correct conclusions
	- This is why one should open for rational criticism
	- The final judgement can only be a judgement by results
