## Ch 1 The Basic Equipment
- Arguments are either valid or invalid, while proposition are either true or false.
- **Proposition**: Whatever may be asserted or denied
	- Characteristic is truth and falsity
	- **Refute**: Show that a proposition is true, and not just saying
- Arguments concern about relations between propositions
- A valid argument does not imply that its constituent propositions are true
	- A valid deduction means that denying its conclusion will lead to contradictions with its premise
- Reason someone will insist on a contradictory statement:
	- Disingenuous
	- Does not fully understand the meaning of the words used
		- **Universal proposition fallacy**: Over-generalisation of a few instances
		- **Equivocation**: Using the same word for 2 or more different meanings without differentiating it in the same context

	> **Socrates**  
	> We must follow the argument wherever it leads.
- From any pair of contradictory propositions affirmed, any propositions (including their negations) can be proven to be true
	- Suppose the contradiction is x and ~x <br>
	Consider an arbitrary statement y <br>
	Then x or y must be true <br>
	And if we also assert ~x to be true, then necessarily y must be true, regardless of what y is.

	> **Bertrand Russell**  
	> A pedant is a person who prefers his statements to be true
- **Logically impossible**: Something that leads to self-contradiction
- **Factually impossible**: Something that is prohibited by the laws of nature
