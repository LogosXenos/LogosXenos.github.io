# Full Notes

## Ch 1 Building Blocks for Research Writing
- Typical format of a thesis/research paper: (IMRD format)
	1. Introduction
	2. Methods and materials
	3. Results
	4. Discussion
	5. Conclusion
- Variations of this layout depends on the number of topics covered in the thesis.

## Ch 2 Presenting the Context of Your Research
- An effective introduction should the ordered structure of from general to specific, namely:
	1. Context
	2. Review
	3. Gap
	4. Purpose
- The level of ideas can be categorised into
	1. General area
	2. Sub-area
	3. Key topic
- Techniques for maintaining continuity
	- Transitional words
	- Repetition of keywords 
		- Exact repetition
		- Repetition by pronouns and demonstrative pronouns
		- Repeated words should be close to the beginning, new ideas introduce in the latter part of sentence

## Ch 3 Presenting the Literature Review and Specific Research Gaps
- Methods of linking prior works in review
	- Chronology
	- Similarities or differences
	- Cause-effect
	- Problem-solution
- Evaluate your reviews critically by providing appropriate types of comments
	- Positive evaluations (achievements)
	- Negative evaluations (limitations, weaknesses that are not related to the specific gap addressed in the thesis)
	- Neutral evaluations (deductions, inferences, implications beyond the literature)
- Types of specific gaps:
	- Inadequacies or limitations
	- Conflicting or controversial findings or ideas
	- Extension of ideas in new directions
- Include previews and summaries for the literature review
- Types of statements and its choice of tenses
	1. General statements: Simple Present or Present Perfect
	2. Information prominent statements: Simple Present
	3. Author Prominent Content: Simple Past
	4. Weak Author Prominent Content: Present Perfect
- Attitudes and Tenses involving author prominent citation
	- Findings that are generally accepted as facts: Simple Present
	- Findings restricted to specific study but are not true in all cases: Simple Past
	- Author is tentative about findings or they are making suggestions/proposals: Tentative Verb (Simple Past) + modal auxiliary

## Ch 4 Presenting the Aims and Significance of Your Research
- State objective of study specifically and concisely, following from the research gap
- State the potential significance of study and the scope of your work after statement of purpose
	- The statement of significance in the introduction typically uses model auxiliaries to show degree of tentativeness
		- **Decreasing level of certainty:** will, would, should, may, could
	- The scope tells the reader the boundary of the research
- When writing aim, put the "what" before the "how"
- Perspective of statement of purpose:
	- **Research Orientation:** The research is done, so use Simple Past Tense
	- **Report Orientation:** Refers to what will be achieved in the report later, use Simple Present or Simple Future Tense
- At the end of a chapter, write a paragraph to link with the next chapter
- Focus on what is useful, rather than who it is useful for

## Ch 5 Presenting Results
- Types of information in results:
	- Location of results
	- Highlighting of key data
	- Commenting on key data
	- Optionals:
		- Statement of aim or rationale
		- Statements about relationships or links with other parts of the study
		- Background info (relevant review with supporting citation)
		- Description of materials, methods, or procedures particular to figures, tables, or diagrams
- In the text, only highlight important data in words
- Types of comments:
	- Generalisations from results
	- Comparisons and contrasts with related studies
	- Explanations and speculations 
- Comment Patterns
	- Applies to a particular result
	- Applies to a series of related results
- Tenses:
	- **Location of results**: Simple Present
	- **Highlighting key data**: Simple Past or Simple Present
	- **Generalisation Comment**: Simple Present
	- **Comparison Comment**: Simple Present
	- **Explanation Comment**: Simple Present + Modal

## Ch 6 Presenting the Conclusion
- Introduction and conclusion together frame the thesis
- Function of Conclusion:
	- How research questions in introduction have been addressed
	- How your findings should be interpreted in the larger context
	- Evaluate the practical or theoretical contributions or significance of your research
- Types of information in Conclusion
	- Restate the aim
	- Review key results
	- Relate your work to broader research areas
		- Compare results with previous works
		- Explain key results
		- Generalise from key results
	- Evaluate significance of results
	- Acknowledge limitations
		- (Optional) Evaluation and Justification of limitations
	- Recommend future research
- Conclusions go from specific to general, opposite to introduction
- Relating to research field
	- Compare with existing work
	- Support or contradict existing theory
	- Unexpected or unsatisfactory results
	- Suggests modification to existing explanations or theory
- Tense choice:
	- *Restating aims*: Simple Past or Present Perfect
	- *Reviewing key results*: Simple Past or Simple Present
	- *Comparing with previou findings*: Simple Present
	- *Explaining key results*: Simple Present + level of certainty
	- *Generalising from key results*: Simple Present + level of certainty
	- *Evaluating significance*: Simple Present 
	- *Presenting Limitations*: Simple Past or Simple Present or Modal
	- *Future Research*: Modal or Simple Present
