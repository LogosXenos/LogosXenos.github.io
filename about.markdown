Hello everybody, I am Logos. Long ago, my interest in physics and doodling lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when I realize that I can combine comics and physics together. Fortunately, we don't need an avatar, the master of both comics and physics, to actually start learning physics through comics together. And although my physics and comics skills are decent, I have a lot to learn before I'm ready to help anyone. But I believe, together, we can learn physics...
