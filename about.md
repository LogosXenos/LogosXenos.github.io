# TL;DR
- Hello. Welcome to my blog.
- I am a nobody who knows nothing, but want to learn everything.
- This blog aims to discuss about anything and everything under the sun (subject to my preference, of course).

# Prologue
On a cozy afternoon, about half a year ago, feeling a bit bored, I went to the desk of my fellow friend, Nicholas, and asked him what he was doing at the moment. I could see him typing rapidly in the computer, apparently not working.
>**Me**: What are you working on?<br>
>**Nicholas**: I am writing a blog.

This prompted a lengthy discussion about what he was writing and his visions on the topic of his blog<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>. At the end of the conversation,
>**Nicholas**: You should start your own blog.

The remark took me off-guard. I had to pause for a while, before replying
>**Me**: But I have nothing to share. I have nothing to share...

I pursed my lips after I repeated the statement. Nicholas shrugged it off, but I was left deep in thought.

# The Purpose
I have always believed there is something interesting in everyone. There is something to be learned from anyone. The cleaning lady in your office may tell you about her youth and how her generation has grown up. The quiet worker at the corner of the room may tell you how he is learning investment. The lunch lady at the cafeteria can tell you how there was a crowd an hour earlier, and perhaps a gossip or two about her customers. Each of these stories may not seem much, but an aggregation of experiences from all walks of life makes you appreciate the little things in life more. By that philosophy then, should I not have something to share to others too?

Perhaps I can talk about my work? Nah, that is one boring subject that most will shudder and run away. Then perhaps I can talk about my philosophy in life? But I do not even know what my philosophy is, much less talk about it with other people. In fact, I had not read much philosophy myself. Maybe I should write an autobiography then, to talk about my daily life? But someone has already beat me to it by more than a century<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>, and I did not really like the book either. So what does that left me?

# On Discussions
Several months have passed, and I was discussing some matter with Seymour, another friend of mine.
>**Seymour**: I don't really see why you like discussions so much. It all just seemed a bit pointless. <br>
>**Me**: Why is that so? <br>
>**Seymour**: Well, we normally talk about things both of us don't really know. How is that conducive?

Seymour has a point. However, if we already know the answer, how is that a discussion? To me, a discussion is a platform where two parties who don't know much about something come together and leave with more knowledge than before. Each of us has a unique perspective to the subject matter, and by exchanging thoughts and ideas, we merge our ideas together to give birth to something new. That is what I enjoy the most, the amalgamation and birth of ideas. Wouldn't it be nice if the internet has a nice platform for us to do so?

Then my mind clicked. I saw the purpose of my blog. I should not pretend to be someone sitting on the alter disseminating wisdom to the people on the internet. I am not that, and I can never be that. In fact, I should be doing what I enjoy the most, discussing my thoughts. I should use my blog as a platform to discuss about anything and everything under the sun (or beyond if you want to talk about astronomy).

# The Blog
And so 6 months after the chanced encounter, this blog is born<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup>. What can you expect from this blog? I do not have a common theme throughout the blog. I will talk about topics and ideas that come up in my daily life. I will also probably talk about books and movies I have read and watched, and what I think about them. I do not pretend that I know everything or that I am always right. That is what discussion is for. Feel free to email me or tweet about anything you want to discuss about (until I learn how to add comments in posts; meanwhile let's discuss over at Twitter).

That said, will I be editing my past posts? Yeah, of course. What is the point of discussion if one is not allowed to change his/her opinions. In fact, the correct way to discussion is to be prepared to have opinions changed, and perhaps several worlds shattered even.

# Conclusion
Let's build a platform where everyone and anyone can talk about everything and anything, in a civilised and conducive way.

# Cipher
Apart from being talkative, I am also someone who likes to solve puzzles. So, in honour of that, I will try to include a cipher puzzle for each post. For this page, the cipher will be

Have fun!
